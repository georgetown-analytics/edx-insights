EdX Insights Georgetown Data Science Capstone Project

This project examined data from student clicks (including click type, clock time, and time in video) on videos (n=323) in three Georgetown University MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to determine if there were distinct viewing patterns among groups of students. We sought to predict, based on the click data, whether or not a student was likely to finish the course. The analysis suggests that a prediction would depend on multiple factors, or features. To date, the best-performing feature set included total click rate, fast-forward rate, rewind-rate, and the average percentage of videos watched, [data removed]. These results are promising but inconclusive.
